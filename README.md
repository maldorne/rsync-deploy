# rsync-deploy

Deploy to a remote server using rsync.

Example usage to sync everything in the workspace folder:

```
- name: Deploy to server
  uses: maldorne/rsync-deploy@v2.0
  env:
    DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_SSH_KEY }}
    REMOTE_USER: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
    REMOTE_SERVER: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_SERVER }}
    REMOTE_PORT: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PORT }}
    REMOTE_PATH: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
    FOLDER: "./"
    EXCLUDE_LIST: ".github/workflows/exclude.txt"
```

If you only want to sync a specific subfolder you can put that folder in the `FOLDER` env var instead.

The `EXCLUDE_LIST` is a file with a list of files/directories that will be ignored during the rsync.
